                <h4>Learn the basics very well</h4>
                <p>When you start coding, learn the basics very well. Don't rush into complicated coding too quickly.</p>

                <p>Try to understand everything you learn and repeat similar code challenges multiple times.</p>

                <h4>Just don't give up!</h4>
                <p>Learning new things is hard. But you can do it! Just take it step by step. Even when you feel like you're going nowhere,
                    you're actually building a steady foundation. Just don't give up.
